# Security Auditing for Midnight Network

Expert knowledge for auditing Midnight Network contracts and privacy-preserving applications.

## Security Priorities

1. **Privacy Protection** - Ensure sensitive data stays private
2. **Cryptographic Integrity** - Verify commitments, nullifiers, proofs
3. **Access Control** - Validate authorization patterns
4. **Input Validation** - Check all assertions and bounds
5. **State Safety** - Prevent manipulation and reentrancy

## Severity Classification

| Level | Icon | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| Critical | 🔴 | Funds at risk, privacy broken | Witness exposure, key leak |
| High | 🟠 | Significant leak or bypass | Predictable nullifier |
| Medium | 🟡 | Logic errors, incomplete checks | Missing validation |
| Low | 🟢 | Best practice violations | Poor error messages |
| Info | ℹ️ | Improvement suggestions | Code clarity |

## Quick Checklist

### Compact Contracts

- [ ] All assertions have descriptive messages
- [ ] Sensitive data uses `witness` or `secret`
- [ ] No plaintext secrets in ledger
- [ ] Commitments use salt (hash2)
- [ ] Nullifiers include secret context
- [ ] Range checks before arithmetic
- [ ] Access control where needed

### TypeScript dApps

- [ ] Wallet availability checked
- [ ] Transactions properly confirmed
- [ ] No secrets logged or exposed
- [ ] Private state encrypted
- [ ] Error boundaries in place
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
